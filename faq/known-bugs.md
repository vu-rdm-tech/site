# Known bugs and workarounds

### Publication: Clicking on a DOI of a new published dataset leads to a "Page not Found" error
We are working with SURF to fix this bug. If possible defer submitting a dataset for publication until the bug is fixed. 

If time is of the essence please let us know via your data steward so we can prioritize fixing your dataset DOI.

### Special Characters (space): a space in folder names prevent the accessibility of a metadata form
If a folder path contains a space (e.g. "research-ub-test-dataset1/first experiment"), clicking on the metadata button in that folder leads to a "Page not Found" error.

Workaround: rename the folder so it does not contain spaces, for example by subsituting with hyphens "-" or underscores "_".

Please note avoiding spaces and other special characters (e.g.: ``~!@#$%^&*()+"';:=/\<>{}`?![]|``) in file and folder names is best practice. Although Yoda allows the use of special characters they are often interpreted differently by other file systems.
