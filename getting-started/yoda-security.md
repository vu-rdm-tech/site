# Other Security Considerations for YODA

## Folder Structure

Make sure to plan ahead on how to structure your folders in YODA. You can find information on planning folder structure in YODA on this [YODA instructions page](https://fgb-rdm.nl/rdm/tools/YODAInstructionsFGB.html#folderStructure){target="_blank"} from the Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences (FGB). Folder structure also plays an important role later on if you choose to publish your data, but some of the data should not be open access. The FGB [YODA instructions page](https://fgb-rdm.nl/rdm/tools/YODAInstructionsFGB.html#safePublishing){target="_blank"} explains this further.

## Additional Data Protection Considerations

The FGB [YODA instructions page](https://fgb-rdm.nl/rdm/tools/YODAInstructionsFGB.html#Data_Protection){target="_blank"} goes into detail about additional data protection considerations for data of various risk levels. While the guide is specific to the Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, the information may also be relevant to you, especially if you work with health data or social sciences data.
